                    Moshe Safdie, CC, architect, professor, urban planner, educator, theorist, author (born 14 July 1938
                    in
                    Haifa, Palestine [now Israel]). A Companion of the Order of Canada, Moshe Safdie’s architectural
                    designs
                    include residential housing, galleries, fine arts complexes, parks, airports, museums, colleges,
                    libraries, government buildings, memorials, masterplans and multi-use complexes. He is perhaps best
                    known in Canada for the Habitat 67 housing complex in Montréal, the National Gallery in Ottawa and
                    Vancouver Library Square. Safdie’s influence is wide reaching, covering nearly 100 projects on five
                    continents. His Boston-based office has extended its branches to Jerusalem, Toronto, Singapore and
                    Shanghai.

                    Safdie moved with his family to Montréal in 1953. He was educated at McGill University, where he
                    graduated in 1961. After apprenticing with American architect Louis Kahn in Philadelphia, he
                    returned to
                    Montréal in 1964 to oversee the realization of his student thesis: the Habitat 67 model housing
                    complex
                    built for Expo 67 in Montréal, which earned Safdie the 1967 Construction Man of the Year Award from
                    Engineering News Record and the Massey Medal for Architecture. Habitat 67 was also named a historic
                    monument by the government of Québec in 2009.

                    Although based in Boston, Massachusetts, since 1978, Safdie has continued to design Canadian
                    projects.
                    His increasing interest in historical, formal and contextual issues is evident in his Canadian
                    designs
                    from the 1980s on, such as the major expansion of Ottawa City Hall (1994), which respects the much
                    admired earlier building designed by Rother, Bland and Trudeau in 1958, and his 1995 design for
                    Vancouver Library Square. The latter confronts the clutter of a decayed downtown setting with a
                    powerful
                    elliptical form reminiscent of the Roman Coliseum. Curving doubled and windowed walls enclose a
                    covered
                    plaza with shops and the library entrance, as well as the rectangular library building itself. The
                    library building, set within the elliptical enclosure, contrasts a modernist glass and metal
                    vocabulary
                    with the attached columns and horizontal bands, which articulate the curved brown concrete walls to
                    give
                    it a distinctly archaic character. This collection of large public buildings use extensive glazed
                    areas,
                    emphasizing Safdie’s belief that light in architecture is integral and has a value beyond the
                    functional, blending the interior with the exterior and inviting those outside in.

                    Safdie’s other major works in Canada include the National Gallery of Canada (1988), Ottawa; the
                    Musée de
                    la Civilisation (for which he received a Governor General's Award for Architecture in 1992), Québec
                    City; renovations and a major addition to the Montréal Museum of Fine Arts (1991); and the new
                    terminal
                    at Lester B. Pearson Airport (2007), Toronto, in a joint venture with Adamson Associates and
                    Skidmore,
                    Owings & Merrill. Among his latest such Canadian projects is a major residential project for
                    Toronto,
                    Parkside Residential Development.

                    Moshe Safdie and Associates has become a major international practice with projects in many
                    countries,
                    notably Israel, where Safdie designed the Yad Vashem Holocaust History Museum (2005) in Jerusalem
                    and
                    the Ben Gurion International Airport (2004) in Tel Aviv. He has designed many buildings in the US as
                    well, among them the United States Institute of Peace Headquarters (2011) in Washington, DC, the
                    Crystal
                    Bridges Museum of American Art (2011) in Bentonville, Arkansa, and the Kauffman Center for the
                    Performing Arts (2011) in Kansas City, Missouri.
                <p>
                    On the larger world stage are projects such as the Khalsa Heritage Centre (2011) in Anandpur Sahib,
                    India, and the astonishing design for the Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort (2011) in Singapore.
                    This
                    mixed-use complex, which has been referred to as a colossal Stonehenge, contains a 55-storey hotel,
                    convention centre and exhibition facilities, while its profile appears as though a gigantic canoe or
                    curved sled has been perched atop three unconventional, curved towers.

                    Safdie has created other designs in Jerusalem, Mexico City, Singapore, Tehran, India, China and
                    Puerto
                    Rico. This international portfolio has allowed him to exploree his design ideas on unprecedented
                    scales.

                <p>
                    Beginning with Habitat 67, and developing into lighter and more economical versions, Safdie has
                    explored
                    prefabricated concrete assemblies of cellular multi-unit housing. These cellular units create
                    diverse,
                    irregular, informal groupings; the images created recall the medieval hill towns of Europe and the
                    densely packed traditional cities of North Africa and the Middle East. Safdie refined this type of
                    community building in a high-density residential community for middle class families he created in
                    Qinhuangdao, China. Called Golden Dream Bay, it is expected to be completed by the end of 2014. A
                    garden, as studied formally in Habitat 67, is integral to each housing unit, yet the complexity of
                    the
                    overall project shows immense refinement since the Habitat project.

                    In addition to writing extensively about his work, Safdie has also taught at McGill University, Ben
                    Gurion University of the Negev in Beer-Sheva, Israel, and at Yale University. From 1978 to 1984, he
                    was
                    director of the Urban Design program at Harvard University, where he continued as the Ian Woodner
                    Professor of Architecture and Urban Design until 1989. Safdie constantly revisits his ideas about
                    people
                    and places, planning and site context as well as the design process. His book For Everyone a
                    Garden(1974) still serves as a reference in his offices today.

                    A 2010–11 exhibition that premiered at Canada's National Gallery and subsequently travelled to the
                    US
                    characterized Safdie as a "global citizen." His projects speak volumes of his desire to understand
                    cultures, people and to create a more humane architecture. He has been featured in Donald Winkler’s
                    documentary Moshe Safdie: The Power of Architecture (2004), which highlights his visionary successes
                    over the course of his career. The sheer number and diversity of Safdie's projects prompted one
                    commentator in the film to remark, "Whoever said we mellow with age obviously hadn't met Moshe
                    Safdie.
                    The Israeli-Canadian architect continues to work on grand projects at a prodigious rate, while
                    remaining
                    an outspoken critic of the shortcomings and blind spots of current architectural practice."

                    Moshe Safdie was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1986 and promoted to Companion in 2005.
                    The
                    Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (RAIC) named him to its College of Fellows in 1982, and
                    awarded
                    him the RAIC Gold Medal in 1995, the year he also became a fellow of the American Institute of
                    Architects (AIA). Other AIA awards include a 1993 Honor Award for the Harvard Business School Class
                    of
                    1959, and an Institute Honor Award for the Salt Lake City Public Library in 2004. The RAIC's Prix du
                    XXe
                    siècle, recognizing enduring excellence in nationally significant architecture, was awarded to
                    Safdie in
                    2007 for his design for Habitat 67. His architectural documents are held at the McGill University
                    Archives.
